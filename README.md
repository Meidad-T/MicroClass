## MicroClass
is an app I tried making for my sister's iPad so she could record lectures and transcribe them to export them locally on her device. 
The original idea was allowing her to send the recording to Gemini and stuffs but I never got to work on it for now.

HOWEVER my friend Kelvin wanted to see my code as inspirtation for his other projects, to which I agreed - hence why you are able to find this repo and read this.
if you have any questions about the repo or code or to be honest anything else, please reach out! 
You can find my contact info on my profile.

Peace!
